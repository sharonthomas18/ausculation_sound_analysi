# ausculation_sound_analysis
Final Year Thesis - 
Python 
The lung sound signals are analysed by decomposing the lung sound signals into frequency sub-bands and feature are extracted. 
These feature vectors are fed into classifiers. 
In this project, the performance of wavelet decomposition and PSD using Welch method in combination with kNN and GMM will be evaluated. 



The effect of different compression rates applied on the LS are also evaluated.
